Points which i found interesting or confusing about AIML :

INTERESTING :
AI and ML can itself learn and adapt from the data, which leads to the development of systems that can understnd images , play different games , speech recognisation and translate languages at superhuman levels

CONFUSING :
Some AI models operate as "black boxes," making it challenging to understand how they arrive at their decisions, which can raise concerns about bias, ethics, and trustworthiness.
